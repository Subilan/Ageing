# Ageing

**Ageing** is an age-themed experience and level system in Minecraft. Players can grow up by either killing mobs and picking resources or just staying in the server for a couple of times, you can change this in the configuration file in the future if you like :)

## On hold notice

This project will not actually begin until my return in the August 2020. Anyone can help by opening pull requests during this time, and I will check them as soon as I get free.
